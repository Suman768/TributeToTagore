                        <strong>Rabindranath Tagore</strong> , Bengali Rabīndranāth Ṭhākur, (born May 7, 1861, Calcutta
                        [now Kolkata], India—died August 7, 1941, Calcutta), Bengali poet, short-story writer, song
                        composer, playwright, essayist, and painter who introduced new prose and verse forms and the use
                        of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based
                        on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing Indian culture to the West and
                        vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of early
                        20th-century India. In 1913 he became the first non-European to receive the Nobel Prize for
                        Literature. The son of the religious reformer Debendranath Tagore, he early began to write
                        verses, and, after incomplete studies in England in the late 1870s, he returned to India. There
                        he published several books of poetry in the 1880s and completed Manasi (1890), a collection that
                        marks the maturing of his genius. It contains some of his best-known poems, including many in
                        verse forms new to Bengali, as well as some social and political satire that was critical of his
                        fellow Bengalis. In 1891 Tagore went to East Bengal (now in Bangladesh) to manage his family’s
                        estates at Shilaidah and Shazadpur for 10 years. There he often stayed in a houseboat on the
                        Padma River (the main channel of the Ganges River), in close contact with village folk, and his
                        sympathy for them became the keynote of much of his later writing. Most of his finest short
                        stories, which examine “humble lives and their small miseries,” date from the 1890s and have a
                        poignancy, laced with gentle irony, that is unique to him (though admirably captured by the
                        director Satyajit Ray in later film adaptations). Tagore came to love the Bengali countryside,
                        most of all the Padma River, an often-repeated image in his verse. During these years he
                        published several poetry collections, notably Sonar Tari (1894; The Golden Boat), and plays,
                        notably Chitrangada (1892; Chitra). Tagore’s poems are virtually untranslatable, as are his more
                        than 2,000 songs, which achieved considerable popularity among all classes of Bengali society.

                        WORKS
                    </h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        Tagore performing the title role in Valmiki Pratibha (1881) with his niece Indira Devi as the
                        goddess Lakshmi.
                        Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother Jyotirindranath. He
                        wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty — Valmiki Pratibha which was shown at
                        the Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated that his works sought to articulate "the play of feeling and
                        not of action". In 1890 he wrote Visarjan (an adaptation of his novella Rajarshi), which has
                        been regarded as his finest drama. In the original Bengali language, such works included
                        intricate subplots and extended monologues. Later, Tagore's dramas used more philosophical and
                        allegorical themes. The play Dak Ghar (The Post Office'; 1912), describes the child Amal defying
                        his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A
                        story with borderless appeal—gleaning rave reviews in Europe—Dak Ghar dealt with death as, in
                        Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified
                        creeds". Another is Tagore's Chandalika (Untouchable Girl), which was modelled on an
                        ancient Buddhist legend describing how Ananda, the Gautama Buddha's disciple, asks a tribal girl
                        for water. In Raktakarabi ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders") is an allegorical struggle against a
                        kleptocrat king who rules over the residents of Yaksha puri.
                        Chitrangada, Chandalika, and Shyama are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which
                        together are known as Rabindra Nritya Natya.

                        <strong>Short stories</strong> :
                        Cover of the Sabuj Patra magazine, edited by Pramatha Chaudhuri
                        Tagore began his career in short stories in 1877—when he was only sixteen—with "Bhikharini"
                        ("The Beggar Woman"). With this, Tagore effectively invented the Bengali-language short
                        story genre. The four years from 1891 to 1895 are known as Tagore's "Sadhana" period (named
                        for one of Tagore's magazines). This period was among Tagore's most fecund, yielding more than
                        half the stories contained in the three-volume Galpaguchchha, which itself is a collection of
                        eighty-four stories. Such stories usually showcase Tagore's reflections upon his
                        surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on interesting mind puzzles (which Tagore was
                        fond of testing his intellect with). Tagore typically associated his earliest stories (such as
                        those of the "Sadhana" period) with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these
                        characteristics were intimately connected with Tagore's life in the common villages of, among
                        others, Patisar, Shajadpur, and Shilaida while managing the Tagore family's vast
                        landholdings. There, he beheld the lives of India's poor and common people; Tagore thereby
                        took to examining their lives with a penetrative depth and feeling that was singular in Indian
                        literature up to that point. In particular, such stories as "Kabuliwala" ("The Fruitseller
                        from Kabul", published in 1892), "Kshudita Pashan" ("The Hungry Stones") (August 1895), and
                        "Atithi" ("The Runaway", 1895) typified this analytic focus on the downtrodden. Many of the
                        other Galpaguchchha stories were written in Tagore's Sabuj Patra period from 1914 to 1917, also
                        named after one of the magazines that Tagore edited and heavily contributed to.

                    <p class="para">
                        Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Chaturanga, Shesher Kobita, Char Odhay,
                        and Noukadubi. Ghare Baire (The Home and the World)—through the lens of the idealistic zamindar
                        protagonist Nikhil—excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the
                        Swadeshi movement; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914
                        bout of depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil's—likely
                        mortal—wounding.
                        Gora raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with Ghare Baire, matters
                        of self-identity (jāti), personal freedom, and religion are developed in the context of a family
                        story and love triangle.[107] In it an Irish boy orphaned in the Sepoy Mutiny is raised by
                        Hindus as the titular gora—"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he chastises Hindu
                        religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them against
                        his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to
                        reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" advancing "arguments for
                        and against strict traditionalism", it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value
                        of all positions within a particular frame not only syncretism, not only liberal
                        orthodoxy, but the extremest reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what humans
                        share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity conceived of as dharma."In Jogajog
                        (Relationships), the heroine Kumudini—bound by the ideals of Śiva-Sati, exemplified
                        by Dākshāyani—is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and
                        compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist
                        leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and
                        family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry.[109] The story
                        revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on
                        the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance.
                        Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She
                        had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.Others
                        were uplifting: Shesher Kobita—translated twice as Last Poem and Farewell Song—is hiS most
                        lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains
                        elements of satire and postmodernism and has stock characters who gleefully attack the
                        reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar
                        name: "Rabindranath Tagore". Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works,
                        they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: Chokher Bali and
                        Ghare Baire are exemplary. In the first, Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a
                        rebellious widow who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning
                        on the part of widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and
                        loneliness. Tagore wrote of it: "I have always regretted the ending"

                    <p class="para">
                        Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit. His songs are known as
                        rabindrasangit ("Tagore Song"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which—poems or
                        parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the thumri style of
                        Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like
                        Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal colour of
                        classical ragas to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm
                        faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ragas. Yet about nine-tenths of his work
                        was not bhanga gaan, the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western,
                        Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral
                        culture.
